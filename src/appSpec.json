The design will balance deep, immersive backgrounds with vibrant, electric accents, creating a dynamic yet uncluttered interface. The core principle is to make the music and its discovery the hero, supported by a seamless, responsive, and highly interactive user experience.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. Layout as a Stage: A dual-pane structure (sidebar + main content) provides clear navigation and focus. The main content area will dynamically adapt, featuring large visual elements like banners and grids, interspersed with interactive lists.\n2. Typographic Hierarchy as Rhythm: A clean sans-serif font will establish a clear hierarchy, with distinct weights and sizes guiding the user through content, from headlines to song details.\n3. Color as Emotion: A deep, dark base palette will create immersion, while a vibrant neon green accent will highlight interactive elements, calls-to-action, and key information, evoking energy and modernity.\n4. Interaction as Flow: Smooth animations, subtle hover effects, and responsive transitions will ensure a fluid and engaging user journey, making every interaction feel deliberate and polished.\n5. Glassmorphism & Soft Shadows: These elements will add depth and a premium feel, subtly separating layers and components without overwhelming the dark theme.",
